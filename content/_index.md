Hi I am George,

I am a Software Engineer, specialized on backend infrastructure using Java as main language, more specific Spring ecosystem.

My strong asset is to focus on the problem, solving it quick, fast and with minimum effort.

This is my personal portfolio and blog, I inspired to create my blog to share my personal experience of my job, some `DONTS` that I have seen as enginner and some mindsepts.
