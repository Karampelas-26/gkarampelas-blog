<p>But this is not mean that you can not be a programmer or to start your carrer as programmer, as I believe are small steps every day of learning something new, passion to spend hours infront of your dark theme (or white for the boomers) and eager to explore.</p>
<p>If you have the patience to search on all the Stack over flow or chat with Chat GPT with hours, I&rsquo;m sorry you are not a programmer.
Programmer is that guy that can understand your problem and solve it with technology, he is gonna chose a programming language, framework, database, host and every technology that fits more on your problem/idea&hellip;</p>
<p>The ideal is a little utopian, in simple way a good programmer will understand the problem or your crazy idea.
First he will design and implement for you like a black box, that means that you do not have any idea of this works, what programming language he use or framework. As client you care only for the solution, you want it quick, solid and scalable. For this reason to be a programmer is not to master a programming language, a framework or a database, the point is to understand the world of how things works and for this is good to start with the fundamentals on Computer Science, take a look on <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-fundamentals-tutorial/">here</a>. Taking a look on fundamentals of the computer science you will have better perception on how things could work in &ldquo;theory&rdquo; but here is the trick, the theory is the hard part of the programming. If you know theoritically how you could implement it you can learn easier something while you working on that, but if you master Java without understand what CLI stands for or API, it is worthless, it is like you want to master swimming to cross the Sahara desert.</p>
<p>My point is that you have to be patient to master a programming language and try to invest on more things like fundamentals on something, try to understand how Java could work behind the scenes and the try to master it, understand how a database works and then master it. Investing in fundamentals you understand how thinks work and you start programming languages as tools and with small effort to be able to learn another language in short period.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Each programming language is just a way that someone like to solve the same problem, so focus on solving the problem, the how you always finds it on the go.</p>
